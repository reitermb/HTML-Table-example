  <p>New Applicant:</p>
  <h4>Guidance: A newly-approved applicant means the current reporting month is the first month in which the TANF family receives TANF assistance (and thus has had a chance to be reported on). This may be either the first month that the TANF family has ever received assistance or the first month of a new spell on assistance. A TANF family that is reinstated from a suspension is not a newly, approved applicant.</h4>
  <h4>Instruction: Enter the one-digit code that indicates whether or not the TANF family is a newly-approved applicant.</h4>
  <p>1= Yes, a newly-approved application 2= No.</p>

  <p>A family with a minor child head-of-household should be coded as either a single-parent family or two-parent family, whichever is appropriate.</p>
  <p>If the family receiving assistance includes a custodial and noncustodial parent, then, if neither parent is disabled, the family should be coded as a two-parent family. A noncustodial parent is defined in section 260.30 as a parent who lives in the State or States (in which the Tribal Service area is located) and does not live with his/her child(ren). The Tribe must report information on the noncustodial parent if the noncustodial parent:</p>
  <p>(1) Is receiving assistance as defined in Sec. 260.31; (2) is participating in work activities as defined in the Tribal plan; or</p>
  <p>(3) has been designated by the Tribe as a member of a family receiving assistance.</p>

  <p>Amount of Food Stamp Assistance:</p>
  <h4>Guidance: For situations in which the food stamp household differs from the TANF family, code this element in a manner that most accurately reflects the resources available to the TANF family.</h4>
  <p>One acceptable method for calculating the amount of food stamp assistance available to the TANF family is to prorate the amount of food stamps equally among each food stamp recipient then add together the amounts belonging to the TANF recipients to get the total amount for the TANF family.</p>
  <h4>Instruction: Enter the TANF family's authorized dollar amount of food stamp assistance for the reporting month or for the month used to budget for the reporting month.</h4>
  </li>

  <li data-list-text="19.">
  <p>Amount of Child Support:</p>
  <h4>Instruction: Enter the total dollar value of child support received on behalf of the TANF family in the reporting month or for the month used to budget for the reporting month.

For purposes of this data element, a new child-only family is a TANF family that: (a) has received TANF assistance for at least two months (i.e., the reporting month and the month prior to the reporting month); (b) received benefits in the prior month, but not as a child-only case; and (c) is a child- only family for the reporting month. All other families--including those that are not a child-only case during the reporting month-- are coded as &ldquo;not a new-child-only family&rdquo;, i.e., as code &ldquo;2&rdquo;.</h4>
  <h4>Instructions: If the TANF family is a new child-only family, enter code &ldquo;1&rdquo;. Otherwise, enter code &ldquo;2&rdquo;.</h4>
  <p>1= Yes, a new child-only family.</p>
  <p>2= No, not a new child-only family.</p>
  <p>Person-Level Data</p>
  <p>Person-level data has two sections: (1) The adult and minor child head- of-household characteristic section and (2) the child characteristics section. Section 419 of the Act defines adult and minor child. An adult is an individual that is not a minor child. A minor child is an individual who (a) has not attained 18 years of age or (b) has not attained 19 years of age and is a full-time student in a secondary school (or in the equivalent level of vocational or technical training).</p>
  <p>Detailed data elements must be reported on all individuals unless, for a specific data element, the instructions explicitly give Tribes an option to not report for a specific group of individuals.</p>
  <h4><a name="bookmark5"></a>Adult and Minor Child Head-of-Household Characteristics</h4>
  <p>This section allows for coding up to six adults (or a minor child who is either a head-of-household or married to the head-of-household and up to five adults) in the TANF family. A minor child who is either a head-of-household or married to the head-of-household should be coded as an adult and will hereafter be referred to as a &ldquo;minor child head- of-household&rdquo;. For each adult (or minor child head-of-household) in the TANF family, complete the adult characteristics section. A noncustodial parent is defined in section 260.30 as a parent who lives in the State or States (in which the Tribal Service area is located) and does not live with his/her child(ren). The Tribe must report information on the noncustodial parent if the noncustodial parent: (1) Is receiving assistance as defined in Sec. 260.31; (2) is participating in work activities as defined in the Tribal Plan; or (3) has been designated by the Tribe as a member of a family receiving assistance.</p>
  <p>The Tribe has the option to count a family with a noncustodial parent receiving assistance as a two-parent family for work participation rate purposes. As indicated below, reporting for certain specified data elements in this section is optional for certain individuals (whose family affiliation code is a 2, 3, or 5).</p>
  <p>If there are more than six adults (or a minor child head-of-household and five adults) in the TANF family, use the following order to identify the persons to be coded: (1) The head-of-household; (2) parents in the eligible family receiving assistance; (3) other adults in the eligible family receiving assistance; (4) parents not in the eligible family receiving assistance; (5) caretaker relatives not in the eligible family receiving assistance; and (6) other persons whose income or resources count in determining eligibility for or amount of assistance of the eligible family receiving assistance, in descending order from the person with the most income to the person with least income (or resources if no income).</p>

  <p>Work Participation Status:</p>
  <h4>Guidance: This item is used in calculating the work participation rates. The following two definitions are used in reporting this item and in determining which families are included in and excluded from the calculations.</h4>
  <p>&ldquo;Disregarded&rdquo; from the participation rate means the TANF family is not included in the calculation of the work participation rate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exempt&rdquo; means that the individual will not be penalized for failure to engage in work (i.e., good cause exception); however, the TANF family is included in the calculation of the work participation rate.</p>
  <p>A Tribe is not required to disregard all families that could be disregarded. For example, a family with a child under 12 months may be disregarded. However, if the family is meeting the work requirements, the Tribe may want to include the family in its work participation rate. In this situation, the Tribe should use work participation status code &ldquo;19&rdquo; rather than code &ldquo;01&rdquo;.</p>
  <h4>Instruction: Enter the two-digit code that indicates the adult's (or minor child head-of-household's) work participation status. If the Tribe chooses to include the noncustodial parent in the two-parent work participation rate, the Tribe must code the data element &ldquo;Type of Family for Work Participation Rate&rdquo; with a &ldquo;2&rdquo; and enter the applicable code for this data element.

While one or more adults may be sanctioned in more than 3 months within the preceding 12- month period, the family may not be disregarded from the participation rate for more than 3 months within the preceding 12-month period).</p>
  <p>03= Disregarded, family is part of an ongoing research evaluation (as a member of a control group or experimental group) approved under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act.</p>

  <p>17= Deemed engaged in work--parent or relative (who is the only parent or caretaker relative in the family) with child under age 6 and parent engaged in work activities for at least 20 hours per week.</p>
  <p>18= Required to participate and participating, but not meeting minimum participation requirements.</p>
  <p>19= Required to participate and meeting minimum participation requirements.</p>
  <p>99= Not applicable (e.g., person living in household and whose income or resources are counted in determining eligibility for or amount of assistance of the family receiving assistance, but not in eligible family receiving assistance or noncustodial parent that the Tribe opted to exclude in determining participation rate).</p>
  <p>Adult Work Participation Activities</p>
  <h4>Guidance: To calculate the average number of hours per week of participation in a work activity, add the number of hours of participation across all weeks in the month and divide by the number of weeks in the month. Round to the nearest whole number.</h4>
  <p>Some weeks have days in more than one month. Include such a week in the calculation for the month that contains the most days of the week (e.g., the week of July 27-August 2, 1997 would be included in the July calculation). Acceptable alternatives to this approach must account for all weeks in the fiscal year. One acceptable alternative is to include the week in the calculation for whichever month the Friday falls (i.e., the JOBS approach). A second acceptable alternative is to count each month as having 4.33 weeks.</p>
  <p>During the first or last month of any spell of assistance, a family may happen to receive assistance for only part of the month. If a family receives assistance for only part of a month, the State (Tribe) may count it as a month of participation if an adult (or minor child head-of-household) in the family (both adults, if they are both required to work) is engaged in work for the minimum average number of hours for any full week(s) that the family receives assistance in that month.</p>
  <p><a href="#bookmark0">Limitations: The limitations</a>1 concerning job search and job readiness are:</p>
  <p>(1) Job search and job readiness assistance only count for 6 weeks in any fiscal year;</p>
  <p>(3) If the Tribe's total unemployment rate for a fiscal year is at least 50 percent greater than the United States' total unemployment rate for that fiscal year, then an individual's participation in job search or job readiness assistance counts for up to 12 weeks in that fiscal year.</p>
  <p>Instruction: For each work activity in which the adult (or minor child head-of-household) participated during the reporting month, enter the average number of hours per week of participation, except as noted above. For each work activity in which the adult (or minor child head-of-household) did not participate, enter zero as the average number of hours per week of participation. These work activity data elements are applicable only for individuals whose family affiliation code is 1.</p>
